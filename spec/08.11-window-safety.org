Title: Context Navigator — 08.11 Window Safety (delete-other-windows remap)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§08.11.1 Rationale
- Prevent a Navigator side-window from becoming the only window after delete-other-windows, preserving the user’s layout.

§08.11.2 Contract (CN-DEL-OTHER-WIN)
- When a Context Navigator sidebar window is present on the current frame:
  - Close all windows showing the Navigator sidebar buffer (windows with parameter 'context-navigator-view = 'sidebar) first.
  - Then invoke the standard delete-other-windows.
- In buffer-mode, only windows marked with 'context-navigator-view = 'buffer are considered Navigator windows.
- When no Navigator windows are present, behave exactly like delete-other-windows.

§08.11.3 Scope
- The remap MUST be present in:
  - context-navigator-mode-map (global mode) to guard global behavior.
  - context-navigator-view-mode-map (sidebar major mode) to guard sidebar-local behavior.
