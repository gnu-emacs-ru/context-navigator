Title: Context Navigator — 11.4 Splits Refit Utility (shared height policies)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§11.4.1 Purpose
- Provide a shared, minimal utility to refit auxiliary splits (Stats/Groups) consistently, avoiding duplication across modules.

§11.4.2 Contract (CN-SPLIT-REFIT)
- Refit triggers:
  - window-size-change events for the Navigator window
  - explicit refit requests from Stats/Groups split modules
- Behavior:
  - Target height: at most 50% of the Navigator sidebar’s current height (configurable in future).
  - Respect manual resizes: once the user has manually resized the split, keep that height until a layout change requires re-fit.
  - No-op when the split buffer/window is not visible.
- Safety:
  - Must not signal errors; be idempotent and cheap.
  - Never create or delete windows on its own; only adjust size of an existing split window.

§11.4.3 Usage
- Stats split (§10.4) and Groups split (§11.1/§11.3) call into this utility to enforce height policies.
- The code lives in context-navigator-splits-refit.el.
