Title: Context Navigator — 08.6 Navigation (TAB, items/groups, segments)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§08.6.1 Interactive segments and properties
- The View marks navigable elements with properties:
  - 'context-navigator-interactive (segments like toggles/actions)
  - 'context-navigator-item (items)
  - 'context-navigator-group-slug (groups)
  - 'context-navigator-action / 'context-navigator-toggle (controls)
- Segment scanners:
  - Next/previous interactive position find runs by properties and use exclusive semantics (skip within-run) (CN-NAV-SCANNERS).

§08.6.2 TAB navigation
- TAB moves to the next interactive element; Shift-TAB moves to the previous (wrap-around) (CN-NAV-TAB).
- The title and stats header act as interactive elements but are skipped by next-item/prev-item commands unless explicitly targeted (CN-NAV-SKIP-TITLE-FOR-ITEMS).

§08.6.3 Item/group navigation
- Next-item (j/Down) and Previous-item (k/Up) move between rows carrying either 'item or 'group-slug (wrap-around), placing point at BOL (CN-NAV-ITEM-MOVES).
- Behavior is consistent across items and groups modes.

§08.6.4 Keymaps
- Major mode map provides minimal remaps; complete bindings come from keyspec (§15).
- Interactive segments inherit the major mode map so navigation keys continue to work inside segments (CN-NAV-INHERIT-PARENT).

§08.6.5 Select by name (CN-NAV-SELECT-BY-NAME)
- Provide a command to jump to and open a context item by label:
  - Uses consult when available (fuzzy/live), falls back to completing-read.
  - Labels are “<name> — <relpath-or-buffer>”; duplicate labels are disambiguated with (N).
  - Opening in other-window is preferred when invoked from the sidebar window.
  - For selection items, activate the region after visiting.
