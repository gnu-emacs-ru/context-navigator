Title: Context Navigator — 00 Conventions and Meta
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§00.1 Purpose and change policy
- This specification is the single source of truth for Context Navigator (CN).
- Process for changes: update spec → update tests → update code.
- Every concept/contract must be defined exactly once; all other places refer to the canonical definition by § number.

§00.2 Scope, structure, and references
- Files under spec/ are numbered (NN-name.org). Sections are referenced as §NN.MM.
- Each spec file starts with Title, Status (Normative/Informative), and Version (independent of the package version).
- No repetition: if a term or contract is already defined elsewhere, write “See §XX.YY”.

§00.3 Normative vs Informative content
- Normative: mandatory contracts, invariants, API signatures, payload schemas, algorithmic steps, configuration semantics.
- Informative: rationale, examples, diagrams, implementation notes.

§00.4 Traceability and IDs
- Each invariant/contract is assigned a unique ID CN-XXX (e.g., CN-STATE-IMMUT).
- §90 Testing maintains a traceability matrix Spec → Tests → Code (function or module symbol).
- Tests use EN locale (stable messages) unless otherwise specified.

§00.5 Versioning and compatibility
- Spec version follows semver for the spec itself; it is decoupled from the Emacs package version (see context-navigator-version).
- Backwards compatibility rules:
  - Minor spec updates may clarify text without changing normative behavior.
  - Major spec updates can change contracts/invariants and must include migration notes where applicable (e.g., persist format).

§00.6 Canonical sources (“define-once → reference”)
- Terms and glossary: §01.3.
- Data model (items, stable keys, diff semantics): §04.
- Event topics and payload shapes: §03.
- Core state and session flags (auto-project, push→gptel), autosave, batch logic: §02.
- GPTel bridge contract: §07.
- Multi-group semantics: §09.
- TRAMP/remote policies and general performance/caches: §19–§20.
- UI textual keys/i18n: §16.

§00.7 Dialectical nodes (contradictions → resolutions)
- UI responsiveness vs async loading → lightweight preloader with spinner; debounced renders (§08, §03.3).
- Predictive indicators vs actual gptel state → predictive snapshot from enabled items refined by :gptel-change events; optional polling (§08.5, §07).
- Multi-group mass operations vs per-item toggles → forbid per-item toggles in MG, use aggregated actions and selection semantics (§09).
- Auto-push vs large selections → threshold gate disables auto-push; manual push remains available (§02.9, §09.6).
- TRAMP correctness vs speed → lazy/strict/off policies for previews/stats; minimize remote IO (§10.3, §19.3, §20).
- Render flicker vs accuracy → render-key; soft refresh vs full re-render; cache relpaths and sorted items per gen/root (§08.1, §19.2).

§00.8 Document conventions
- Keywords like MUST/SHOULD/MAY follow RFC 2119.
- Payload shapes are shown as (topic arg1 arg2 …) or plists where applicable.
- Cross-references use §NN.MM and “See §NN.MM”.
