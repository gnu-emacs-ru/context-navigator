Title: Context Navigator — 12 Multifile View (aggregate/section editing)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§12.1 Purpose
- Provide a single buffer to browse and edit context items across files safely:
  - Sections per item with indicator + icon + [on/off] + name on the left; right-aligned relpath (CN-MF-SECTION-LINE).
  - Actions [visit] [t] [d] [p] as clickable segments (mouse/RET) (CN-MF-ACTIONS).
  - Local filter to show only enabled items (toggle in header) (CN-MF-FILTER).

§12.2 Header-line controls
- Controls:
  - [collapse-all], [filter-enabled-only], [Edit All], [× close]
- Style follows controls §08.4, with icons fallback; clickable segments use sparse keymaps (CN-MF-HEADER-CONTROLS).

§12.3 Section collapses and navigation
- Per-section collapse state by item key; global collapse-all overrides per-section (CN-MF-COLLAPSE).
- TAB toggles the section at point (when on header) or moves to next header (CN-MF-TAB-TOGGLE).
- j/k (or next/prev) navigate between section headers (CN-MF-NAV).

§12.4 Previews and remote policy
- File items:
  - Preview head or full file per configuration with optional byte cap; TRAMP policy: lazy/strict/off (CN-MF-FILE-PREVIEW).
- Selection items:
  - Preview first N lines of the selection region from base buffer/file; robust to stale bounds by clamping (CN-MF-SELECTION-PREVIEW).
- Buffer items:
  - Show note or file preview when visiting file is available (CN-MF-BUFFER-PREVIEW).

§12.5 Editing selections (indirect + narrow)
- Edit:
  - Clone an indirect buffer of the base, narrow to region (clamped to current buffer bounds), make writable, add after-save hook for auto-push (CN-MF-INDIRECT-EDIT).
- After-save auto-push:
  - When push→gptel is ON, apply the current model to GPTel after save (CN-MF-AFTER-SAVE).
- Edit All:
  - Open indirect buffers for all selection items (with confirmation beyond threshold) (CN-MF-EDIT-ALL).

§12.6 GPTel actions
- [p] toggles membership of the item in GPTel explicitly (ignores auto-push flag), reporting :added/:removed/:noop (CN-MF-GPTEL-TOGGLE).
- Indicators reflect cached GPTel keys (CN-MF-INDICATORS).

§12.7 Cleanup
- On Multifile buffer close:
  - Unsubscribe buffer-local events; kill indirect buffers if configured (CN-MF-CLEANUP).
