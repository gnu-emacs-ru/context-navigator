Title: Context Navigator — 11 Groups Split (bottom pane)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§11.1 Purpose and layout
- Bottom pane listing groups for quick selection and management.
- Height:
  - At most half of the Navigator sidebar height by default; fit dynamically (CN-GSPLIT-FIT).
- Keyboard:
  - Dedicated keymap; inherits Navigator view map for consistency (CN-GSPLIT-KEYS).

§11.2 Rendering and focus
- Render rows similar to §08.3, with selection lamps in MG (CN-GSPLIT-RENDER).
- Opening/focus:
  - Opening the split should retain focus in the Navigator unless explicitly moved (CN-GSPLIT-FOCUS).

§11.3 Lifecycle
- Auto-close:
  - When the Navigator sidebar closes, the split closes too (CN-GSPLIT-AUTO-CLOSE).
- Refit:
  - On Navigator window size changes, refit height to avoid overflow (CN-GSPLIT-REFIT).
