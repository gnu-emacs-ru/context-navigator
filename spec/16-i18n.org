Title: Context Navigator — 16 Internationalization (i18n keys, stability)
Status: Normative
Version: 1.0

§16.1 Dictionary and fallbacks (CN-I18N-DICT)
- Source of truth: English (EN) strings keyed by keywords.
- Locale selection:
  - Auto from environment when interactive; force EN in tests (noninteractive) (CN-I18N-TEST-EN).
- Missing keys:
  - Fallback to EN; never signal errors in UI.

§16.2 Usage and stability (CN-I18N-STABLE)
- All UI-visible strings in controls, headers, previews, prompts, and which-key labels MUST pass through i18n using :desc-key or explicit keys.
- Tests assert on EN strings to ensure stability across environments.

§16.3 Performance
- Small cache optional; lifespan limited to session.
- Cache invalidation on theme change is not required; icons module handles its own refresh.
